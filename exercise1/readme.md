Hello Oxygen! Lets do a JavaScript Exercise
Exercise 1 - Api call
Write a small JavaScript/TypeScript program that fetches data from the following endpoint:

Inspect the data and tell us what you are looking at.

Exercise 2 - Array of names
Create a function that accepts the api results array as input. The result should be an array of strings where each string is a concatenation of the first name and last name.
